Hello! I'm Kevin Burke, a software engineer based in Limerick, Ireland.

This blog is a collection of thoughts about software engineering. 
I believe writing about something forces me to think about it more deeply, hopefully enhancing my understanding, and ultimately becoming a better software engineer.

My background is mostly in Java development. I've worked on large-scale event-driven distributed systems which process millions of events per day. Also have experience designing and creating RESTful APIs, mostly with Spring Boot.
